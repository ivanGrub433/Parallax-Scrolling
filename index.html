            “Books permit us to voyage through time, 
            to tap the wisdom of our ancestors. The library connects us with the insight and knowledge, 
            painfully extracted from Nature, of the greatest minds that ever were, 
            with the best teachers, drawn from the entire planet and from all our history, to instruct us without tiring, 
            and to inspire us to make our own contribution to the collective knowledge of the human species. 
            I think the health of our civilization, 
            the depth of our awareness about the underpinnings of our 
            culture and our concern for the future can all be tested by how well we support our libraries.”
